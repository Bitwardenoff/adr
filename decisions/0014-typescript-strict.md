# Adopt Typescript Strict flag

## Context and Problem Statement

For compatibility reasons since the codebase was originally written in JavaScript we have never been
able to use the TypeScript strict flag. This has lead to several issues with bugs and resulted in a
lower code quality.

### TypeScript Strict

> The `strict` flag enables a wide range of type checking behavior that results in stronger
> guarantees of program correctness. Turning this on is equivalent to enabling all of the strict
> mode family options.
>
> <cite>https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict</cite>

Of particular note is the [Strict Null Checks][null]. By default TypeScript will ignore `false`,
`null` and `undefined` allowing them to be used for any types. When `strictNullChecks` are enabled
they must be explicitly allowed in the type definition.

We are at a certain scale where enforcing more robust coding practices and standardization is more
of a priority that it's worth raising this topic again.

### Typescript strict mode plugin

The [Typescript strict mode plugin][plugin] is a TypeScript plugin that allows you to progressively
turn on strict mode on a file by file basis. This will allow us to progressively update our codebase
to support strict mode without requiring a significant initial engineering effort.

## Considered Options

- **Keep strict disabled** - We will continue to run into null issues, and code quality will be
  lower than it could be.
- **Enable strict flag immediately** - Turn on the strict flag immediately and assign an engineer to
  resolve all errors caused by it. This will take a long time, and result in a multitude of
  conflicts.
- **Progressively enable strict flag** - Use the TypeScript plugin to migrate files one by one.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Progressively enable strict flag**.

<!-- optional: brief reason for decision **or** the positive/negative consequences sections below -->

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- We can immediately start using the strict flag.
- Lower initial developer effort.

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Migration will be slower.
- We will continue to have parts of the code with null issues.
- Might lead to false security if a file is strict but uses non-strict dependencies.
- Few best practices.

### Files to be updated

- libs/common: 310
  - models: 174
  - services: 40
  - abstractions: 45
- libs/angular: 64
- libs/node: 11
- libs/electron: 10
- apps: 309
  - web: 163
  - browser: 80
  - desktop: 30
  - cli: 36

### Plan

There are several potential pitfalls related to progressively enabling strict mode. Which will
benefit from having a plan on how we should tackle the migration. Each category of files should have
a proper example how how they should be migrated. And during the initial migration period we should
not prevent people from adding new files that are not strict. What we should prevent is people
adding new non-strict files in the category that we are currently migrating.

#### Preparation

Enable the plugin and run `update-strict-comments` which adds the `//@ts-strict-ignore` comment to
all files which produce a strict error.

#### Transition

1. Migrate `libs/common/models`.
2. Migrate `libs/common/services` and `libs/common/abstractions`.
3. Migrate remaining `libs/common`.
4. Migrate `libs/angular`.
5. Migrate apps. (And forbid anyone from adding new non-strict files)

### Guidelines

Below are some helpful guidelines for migrating files to strict mode.

#### Avoid null, prefer undefined

The `strictNullChecks` flag essentially requires that we add `| null` to almost all our types. This
is quite annoying and a better approach is to use `undefined` instead. Which allows us to use the
`?` operator to define the fields as optional. This essentially adds a `| undefined` to the type.
