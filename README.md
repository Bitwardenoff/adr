# Bitwarden Architectural Decision Records

An [Architectural Decision (AD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_decision) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant. 
This might, for instance, be a technology choice (e.g., Java vs. JavaScript), a choice of the IDE (e.g., IntelliJ vs. Eclipse IDE), a choice between a library (e.g., [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) vs [java.util.logging](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html)), or a decision on features (e.g., infinite undo vs. limited undo).
